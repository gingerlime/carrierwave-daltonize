# CarrierWave::Daltonize

Adds [daltonize](http://www.daltonize.org/) processing to carrierwave (using ruby-vips).

## Installation

Requires ruby-vips. See https://github.com/jcupitt/ruby-vips

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'carrierwave-daltonize'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install carrierwave-daltonize

## Usage

In your carrierwave uploader, include carrierwave daltonize, and then use
any of the daltonize processing functions.

    class ColourBlindUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
      include CarrierWave::Daltonize

      version :deuteranope
        process :daltonize => :deuteranope
      end

      version :protanope
        process :daltonize => :protanope
      end

      version :tritanope
        process :daltonize => :tritanope
      end
    end

### Standalone

You can also use the ruby code without carrierwave to process an image file.

Usage:
    
    ./lib/daltonize.rb in.jpg out.jpg deuteranope

In your ruby code:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'vips'
    require 'carrierwave-daltonize'

    # to process an image filename for deuteranopia and save it
    Daltonize.daltonize_file(source, destination, :deuteranope)

    # or calling the daltonize function directly

    im = VIPS::Image.new(source)
    im = Daltonize.tritanope(im)
    im.write(destination)

There's also a version of the algorithm in
[nip2](https://github.com/jcupitt/nip2) for easy testing of the
details of the parameters. See 'other' directory. Run with something like:

    nip2 daltonize.ws

This workspace needs version 7.33 or later of nip2.

## CarrierWave::VIPS

Note that CarrierWave::Daltonize no longer relies on [CarrierWave::VIPS](https://github.com/eltiare/carrierwave-vips). You can use it with any other CarrierWave plugin.

However, since you already need ruby-vips to run this, it would make sense to use it too. 

CarrierWave::VIPS should dramatically increase the speed and reduce memory footprint
of your carrierwave image processing.
